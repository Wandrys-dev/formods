\item{inputId}{The input ID of the UI element that was put on hold}

\item{id}{Shiny module ID}

When some buttons are clicked they will change the state of the
system, but other UI components will not detect that change correctly. So those
triggers are put on hold. This will remove the hold after those UI
components have updated.
